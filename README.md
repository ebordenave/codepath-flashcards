## Notes
LOTS of issues-- I spent hours on figuring out the current/longest streaks.
I figured it out and that it was my useEffect hook causing my current streak to double
This was a significantly more difficult project. Connecting components together and having expected behaviors between them was a challenge but overall I enjoyed this.
